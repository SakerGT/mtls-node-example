# Contributing guide

Contributions are welcome. Please clone the repo, create a branch, make any changes you would like to see and create a pull request.  These will be reviewed as soon as possible, but no guaranteed timeframes.

Please check the list of things to be done in [TODO](TODO.md), if you'd like to contribute any part of those, that would be great.
